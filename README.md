# GoLang Web Application Server

A GoLang project to Run a Web Server Application

## How to Run

You need to clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/stallkid/GoLang-WebApplication.git
```

Then navigate to the right folder:

```
cd GoLang-WebApplication
```

and then you need to run the GoLang command to start the application:

```
go run server.go
```

## How it Works

When the project is started you just need to open this url [http://localhost:8080/view/TestPage](http://localhost:8080/view/TestPage).

/view/ url param shows an existing page.

/edit/ url param allows to edit/create a new page.
